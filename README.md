# LinaKretzschmar Portfolio

This web portfolio was created in the class CART 444 at Concordia University. I added some of the finished projects that I created while at Concordia. 
Two more projects will be added to this website once they are finished. The website still has some issues I need to fix which are primarily resizing 
and JQuery transitions that are not as smooth. The portfolio is an ongoing project which will be altered and improved constantly. 


The portfolio can be seen here: https://linakretzsch.github.io/LinaKretzschmarPortfolio/#0
