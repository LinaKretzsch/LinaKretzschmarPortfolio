# Web Portfolio from Lina Kretzschmar

## Project Description
This web portfolio was created in the class CART 444 at Concordia University. I added some of the finished projects that I created while at Concordia. 
Two more projects will be added to this website once they are finished. The website still has some issues I need to fix which are primarily resizing 
and JQuery transitions that are not as smooth. The portfolio is an ongoing project which will be altered and improved constantly. 

### Technical Background


### What needs to be fixed
1. I would like to implement the bootstrap libary in order to have a smoother responsiveness of the website. When the website is resized to mobile size right now, the project image tiles are overlapping due to their 
2. The Nav links work, however the website background is not adjusting properly when the links are used to navigate to the corresponding section.
3. I would like the video playing in the background be responsive to scroll movement and ideally have the 3D background as an object instead of a video so I can interact with it on the website.
