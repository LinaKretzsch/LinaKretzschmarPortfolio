          <p>Hi, my name is Lina, and I am a developer and digital artist who likes to create a
            unique experience with a sleek and finished look. I came to Canada after graduating
            high school in Germany, in the pursuit of the Great White North, travel, and adventure.
            I completed the Bachelor of Computer Science, Major in Computer Applications and Computation
            Arts, which allowed me to explore a range of creative projects, including digital media,
            interactive art, and 3D modeling, as well as learning to code both back- and front-end applications.<br><br>

            I aspire to minimalism in my design to create a narrative that naturally guides the user and
            emphasizes the content that is being presented. My goal is to use my creativity to conceptualize
            my innovative thought process. I am a passionate coder and artist and I feel most empowered in
            the realm where arts and technology collide. Within the field of computation arts, I love
            utilizing my coding skills to create memorable web projects.<br><br>

            I am thrilled and excited to think about possible future projects and hope to learn a myriad
            of skills along the way to constantly grow individually and professionally.</p>

                <h1>MEME AESTHETICS</h1>
              <p>
                Meme Aesthetics is a research project, exploring the aesthetic queues of memes from politically
                left- and right-oriented forums.<br><br>
                The project was created in a team of 3 within the framework
                of an arts-based research course. My 2 teammates used a GAN model to generate images based on a
                database of memes originating politically left- and right-oriented forums.
                My part was to create the website with CSS, HTML and JavaScript, to showcase the final
                computer-generated images in form of a guessing game. Once the user guesses whether the image
                grit is based on left- or right-wing oriented memes, the correct answer is displayed. Additionally,
                the background gradient of the website changes to represent the colors of the Canadian liberal or
                conservative party in order to indicate the political direction of the underlying data set. <br><br>

                <h1>C++ RISK GAME</h1>
                <p>
                  The C++ Risk Game is a project created in a team of 5 within the scope of a C++ course I took at
                  Concordia in 2020. All our team members developed great C++ skills and learned to use GIT in order
                  to collaborate seamlessly. The project was split into 3 assignments and the work was split up per
                  individual. Although the development was sequential at times, my team's excellent communication
                  skills enabled us to work through each assignment seamlessly. I wrote the player class, half of
                  the game setup phase and contributed to the player strategies. Revising my teammates pull requests
                  on GIT was just as important as writing my own code.<br><br>
                  The game's objective is to conquer all the territories of a map by deploying armies that are assigned
                  to every player each turn. One user can play and chose if the other players are played by the computer
                  or their choices entered manually. There is no GUI for this game since the focus was on creating the
                  structural component, but the game can be played using the console.<br><br>

                <h1>WISE OLD MAN</h1>
                <p>
                  Wise Old Man is a 3D animation created in Blender as part of a 3D Modelling course I took at Concordia
                  University 2020. The objective of this project was to create a realistic model based on Roman Semenko ºs
                  character illustrations. The concept art inspired me to create a dark and mysterious look in order to
                  present the model in a fitting narrative.<br><br>
                  The model was first sculpted, then re-topologized and lastly textured by using texture paint and shader
                  nodes to create bump and roughness maps. Once the model and textures were done, I modified the audio which
                  is originally from the intro of the movie Mad Max.The face is moved using shape keys and then combined
                  using animation key frames. Finally, I rendered the animation frame wise in cycles and then compiled
                  the resulting images in Adobe Premiere to a contingent animation. This project pushed my boundaries
                  as an animator and taught me how to sync an animation with audio.

                <h1>SURREAL LOOP</h1>
                <p>
                  The surreal loop was done in Blender as a project of a 3D modelling and animation class I took at
                  Concordia University in 2020. I created the concept with the motivation to create a surrealistic,
                  looping animation. My intention was to create a realistic looking scene with an odd twist. I started
                  by modelling the scene and created the textures using shader nodes in Blender. Then, I used a free
                  model from Turbosquid which was part of task for this project. Since this model was from an older
                  Blender version, I was given restrictions for the animation of the movement. The fur like texture
                  is achieved with hair particles and shader nodes to create a realistic look. Using particle systems
                  and physics in Blender, taught me how to take long rendering times into account while denoising
                  the finished images in a post processor. The final animation was rendered frame wise in cycles and
                  the frames where then assembled to a contingent animation in Adobe Premiere.
