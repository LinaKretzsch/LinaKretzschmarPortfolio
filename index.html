        <p>Hi, my name is Lina, and I am a developer and digital artist who likes to create a
          unique experience with a sleek and finished look. I came to Canada after graduating
          high school in Germany, in the pursuit of the Great White North, travel, and adventure.
          I completed the Bachelor of Computer Science, Major in Computer Applications and Computation
          Arts, which allowed me to explore a range of creative projects, including digital media,
          interactive art, and 3D modeling, as well as learning to code both back- and front-end applications.<br><br>

          I aspire to minimalism in my design to create a narrative that naturally guides the user and
          emphasizes the content that is being presented. My goal is to use my creativity to conceptualize
          my innovative thought process. I am a passionate coder and artist and I feel most empowered in
          the realm where arts and technology collide. Within the field of computation arts, I love
          utilizing my coding skills to create memorable web projects.<br><br>

          I am thrilled and excited to think about possible future projects and hope to learn a myriad
          of skills along the way to constantly grow individually and professionally.</p>

              <h1>MEME AESTHETICS</h1>
              <p>
                Meme Aesthetics is a research project, exploring the aesthetic queues of memes from politically
                left- and right-oriented forums.<br><br>

                The project was created in a team of 3 within the framework
                of an arts-based research course. My 2 teammates used a GAN model to generate images based on a
                database of memes originating politically left- and right-oriented forums.
                My part was to create the website with CSS, HTML and JavaScript, to showcase the final
                computer-generated images in form of a guessing game. Once the user guesses whether the image
                grit is based on left- or right-wing oriented memes, the correct answer is displayed. Additionally,
                the background gradient of the website changes to represent the colors of the Canadian liberal or
                conservative party in order to indicate the political direction of the underlying data set. <br><br>

              <h1>SKETCHQUISITE</h1>
              <p>
                SketchQuisite if a collaborate drawing game, based on the paper and pen game Exquisite Corpse
                and was created as an independent study at Concordia University during the 2021 Winter semester. <br><br>

                The application is constructed of a CSS and HTML structure with JavaScript, jQuery and node.js
                functionality and is hosted on Heroku. When launching the website, each user is assigned a
                unique socket id letting the user either draw the top, mid or bottom part of a sketch. When one
                part each is submitted, the final masterpiece can be admired in the applications gallery. <br><br>

                Working on SketchQuisite has taught me a great deal in organizing a project independently and
                significantly increased my front-end developer skill set. I realized that I no longer hit dead
                ends during my progress and was able to find a solution for virtually any issue I encountered
                along the way. The project is still in progress, and I am currently focussing on implementing
                an AWS database, so that the saved image data can be retrieved upon server restart.<br><br>

              <h1>WISE OLD MAN</h1>
              <p>
                Wise Old Man is a 3D animation created in Blender as part of a 3D Modelling course I took at Concordia
                University 2020. The objective of this project was to create a realistic model based on Roman Semenkoʼs
                character illustrations. The concept art inspired me to create a dark and mysterious look in order to
                present the model in a fitting narrative.<br><br>

                The model was first sculpted, then re-topologized and lastly textured by using texture paint and shader
                nodes to create bump and roughness maps. Once the model and textures were done, I modified the audio which
                is originally from the intro of the movie Mad Max.The face is moved using shape keys and then combined
                using animation key frames. Finally, I rendered the animation frame wise in cycles and then compiled
                the resulting images in Adobe Premiere to a contingent animation. This project pushed my boundaries
                as an animator and taught me how to sync an animation with audio.

              <h1>C++ RISK GAME</h1>
              <p>
                The C++ Risk Game is a project created in a team of 5 within the scope of a C++ course I took at
                Concordia in 2020. All our team members developed great C++ skills and learned to use GIT in order
                to collaborate seamlessly. The project was split into 3 assignments and the work was split up per
                individual. Although the development was sequential at times, my team's excellent communication
                skills enabled us to work through each assignment seamlessly. I wrote the player class, half of
                the game setup phase and contributed to the player strategies. Revising my teammates pull requests
                on GIT was just as important as writing my own code.<br><br>

                The game's objective is to conquer all the territories of a map by deploying armies that are assigned
                to every player each turn. One user can play and chose if the other players are played by the computer
                or their choices entered manually. There is no GUI for this game since the focus was on creating the
                structural component, but the game can be played using the console.<br><br>

              <h1>SURREAL LOOP</h1>
              <p>
                The surreal loop was done in Blender as a project of a 3D modelling and animation class I took at
                Concordia University in 2020. I created the concept with the motivation to create a surrealistic,
                looping animation. My intention was to create a realistic looking scene with an odd twist. I started
                by modelling the scene and created the textures using shader nodes in Blender. Then, I used a free
                model from Turbosquid which was part of task for this project. Since this model was from an older
                Blender version, I was given restrictions for the animation of the movement. The fur like texture
                is achieved with hair particles and shader nodes to create a realistic look. Using particle systems
                and physics in Blender, taught me how to take long rendering times into account while denoising
                the finished images in a post processor. The final animation was rendered frame wise in cycles and
                the frames where then assembled to a contingent animation in Adobe Premiere.

              <h1>PULMONEM</h1>
              <p>
                The web project Pulmonem is the final project of the project studio class I took during the winter
                2021 semester as part of my Bachelor of Computer science at Concordia University. In a team of 4,
                we created a speculative narrative, envisioning a dystopian future where humans have to inject
                themselves with phages in order to grow an exterior lung. The external organ will then enable the
                host to breathe the hazardous air of the earth. <br><br>
                My team created the animated 3D model of the lung, a snapchat filter and the forum on the website,
                while I coded the website itself. The project was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and
                Three.js. Working on Pulmonem has helped me to understand better how to integrate my teams’ visions
                to create a final project we are all proud of. Moreover, I got to experiment with the library
                Three.js which enabled me to create an animated background and therefore increasing the immersive
                experience of Pulmonem. I am currently working on optimizing the website by adding media queries
                in order to create a more seamless window resizing. <br><br>
