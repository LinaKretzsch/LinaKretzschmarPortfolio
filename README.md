# Web Portfolio from Lina Kretzschmar

## Project Description
This web portfolio was created in the class CART 444 at Concordia University. I added some of the finished projects that I created while at Concordia. 
The website still has some issues I need to fix which are primarily resizing and JQuery transitions that are not as smooth. The portfolio is an ongoing project which will be altered and improved constantly. 

### Content
The website show cases several projects I was able to finish during my Computer Science Bachelor at Concordia University. The first page shows a video which will play when the page is loaded and scrolled up. Then, the second page shows the about section, giving a small introduction about who I am and what I do. Subsequently, the next section shows image tiles, which represent the projects I either created by myself or as a team endeavor. The images can be clicked upon, then the website changes and reveals the projects description as well as website and git link (if applicable). The project section can be closed by either clicking the X icon on the bottom of the screen or by scrolling to the previous or next section. Finally, the last section entails the contact section of this portfolio with my LinkedIn, CV, email contact form, and instagram account. 

### Technical Background
I started this project with an online template which enabled the full page scrolling functionality of the website. In addition, the portfolio is composed of the following langugages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery. 

### What needs to be fixed
1. I would like to implement the bootstrap libary in order to have a smoother responsiveness of the website. When the website is resized to mobile size right now, the project image tiles are overlapping due to their 
2. The Nav links work, however the website background is not adjusting properly when the links are used to navigate to the corresponding section.
3. I would like the video playing in the background be responsive to scroll movement and ideally have the 3D background as an object instead of a video so I can interact with it on the website.
